Hi,
I'm Jake, I'm a British Computer Science student.
I build things, and if you're here, this site is where I write about them.

I could write about my latest projects here but I'd probably forget to update this page
So in the bottom left there's a link to my github profile.

There's also the posts section, you could read that too.

Oh I also work for the StoryBuilder Foundation on StoryCAD.
